# Cursor Rules for RateLimiter Project

## Project Context


## Code Style & Standards
- Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for fields)
- Use explicit type declarations where helpful for readability
- Prefer async/await patterns for all public APIs
- Use nullable reference types and handle null cases properly
- Write XML documentation comments for public APIs

## Architecture Patterns
- **Options Pattern**: For configuration management via IOptions<T>
- **Dependency Injection**: Use Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all public methods
- Use xUnit framework with async test patterns
- Mock external dependencies using interfaces
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain high test coverage for critical paths

## Performance Considerations
- All implementations must be thread-safe
- Minimize memory allocations in hot paths
- Consider using Stopwatch for high-precision timing
- Profile memory usage for long-running scenarios

## Error Handling
- Validate input parameters and throw ArgumentException for invalid values
- Use descriptive error messages that help developers
- Log important events for debugging and monitoring

## GitHub Integration
- Use conventional commit messages for clear history
- Create meaningful PR descriptions with architecture explanations
- Tag commits with relevant issue numbers when applicable
- Maintain clean commit history with logical groupings


## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Thread safety verified with lock analysis
- [ ] Unit tests cover happy path and edge cases
- [ ] XML documentation updated for public APIs
- [ ] Performance impact considered for high-throughput scenarios
- [ ] Configuration options properly validated
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable

## Preferred Libraries
- Microsoft.Extensions.* for DI, configuration, and options
- StackExchange.Redis for distributed scenarios
- xUnit for testing framework
- System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch for timing
- Implement core functionality from scratch

## File Organization
- Keep interfaces in `Interfaces/` folder
- Implementations in `Implementations/` folder
- Services and patterns in `Services/` folder
- Configuration in `Configuration/` folder
- Tests in `Tests/` folder
- Tests mirror the main project structure
